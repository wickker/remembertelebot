Okay, I need to explain the reasoning behind Quick Sort in Python. Let's start by recalling how Quick Sort works. The main idea is to pick a pivot element and partition the array such that elements less than the pivot come before it, and those greater come after. Then recursively apply the same to the subarrays.

First, I should mention the divide-and-conquer approach. Quick Sort splits the problem into smaller subproblems. Choosing the pivot is crucial—common methods include picking the first, last, middle element, or a random one. I'll go with the last element for simplicity here.

Next, partitioning. The goal is to rearrange the array around the pivot. Let's visualize the process. We have two pointers: one starting from the beginning (i) and another (j) moving through the array. When j encounters an element less than the pivot, we swap it with the element at i and increment i. This way, elements before i are all less than the pivot. After processing all elements, swap the pivot with the element at i. Now the pivot is in its correct position.

Then, recursion. After partitioning, the array is divided into elements less than the pivot, the pivot itself, and elements greater. We recursively sort the left and right subarrays, excluding the pivot since it's already in place.

Edge cases: if the array has one element or is empty, it's already sorted. So the base case for recursion is when low >= high.

Implementing this in Python. The main function will be quicksort, which takes the array and the low/high indices. The partition function will handle rearranging the elements. Let me outline the steps.

Wait, in Python, lists are mutable, so we can sort in place. The initial call would be quicksort(arr, 0, len(arr)-1). The partition function uses the pivot (say, last element). Loop with j from low to high-1. Compare each element with pivot. If arr[j] <= pivot, swap with arr[i], increment i. Finally, swap pivot (arr[high]) with arr[i]. Return i as the partition index.

Testing with an example: [3,6,8,10,1,2,1]. The first pivot is 1 (the last element). Partitioning moves all elements <=1 to the left. Then the array becomes [1,1, ...] with pivot at index 2. Then recursively sort the left (indices 0-1) and right (3-6).

Potential issues: Choosing a bad pivot (like always the last element) can lead to O(n²) time in worst-case scenarios, like an already sorted array. But on average, it's O(n log n). To optimize, some implementations use a random pivot or median-of-three.

Including these points in the reasoning would make it comprehensive. So the explanation should cover the algorithm steps, pivot selection, partitioning logic, recursion, time complexity, and in-place sorting.
